    "Per definition, Python is a \"multi-paradigm interpreted programming language</i>\"<br>What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "* multi-paradigm: A \"paradigm\" is a way of programming, e.g. \"logic programming\" or \"object-oriented programming\". Python intends to include many paradigms, while maintaining a cute syntax :-)\n",
    "* interpreted programming langague: Usual Python commands or scripts are not directly translated into machine code. This is in contrast to \"compiled\" languages such as C, C++, Rust or Go. Instead, Python commands or scripts are *interpreted* by a Python interpreter. The Python interpreter itself is a compiled (=machine-code-translated) program which performs all neccessary computing steps.\n",
